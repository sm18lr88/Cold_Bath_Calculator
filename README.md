<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3833d25-d641-4f74-bf19-934f94a4f0bb" width="450">

Estimates the amount of ice needed to cool a bath to a desired temperature, considering tank size, water temperature, and user weight.

## Features

*   Calculates ice requirements for cold baths.
*   Supports Metric (liters, °C, kg) and Imperial (gallons, °F, lbs) units.
*   Accounts for water displacement by the user.
*   Simple, clean, dark-themed web interface.

## How to Use

1.  Download `IceBathCalculator.html`.
2.  Open `IceBathCalculator.html` in any modern web browser.
3.  Select your preferred units (Metric/Imperial) using the toggle switch.
4.  Enter:
    *   Max Tank Capacity
    *   Starting Water Temperature
    *   Desired Water Temperature
    *   Person's Weight
5.  Click "Calculate Ice Requirements".
6.  Results will be displayed below the button.

## Calculations

The calculator uses standard physics principles for heat transfer and specific heat capacity to determine the ice needed. It also calculates the net water volume required and the total weight of the water plus the person in it.
